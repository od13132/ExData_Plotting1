## Exploratory Analysis Project (Week 1)

### Overview

This project assigned uses data from the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/), a popular repository for machine learning datasets. In particular, we use the "Individual household electric power consumption Data Set":

Dataset: [Electric power consumption](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip)

Description: Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. 

### Task

For each plot we had to

- Construct the plot and save it to a PNG file with a width of 480 pixels and a height of 480 pixels.

- Name each of the plot files as plot1.png, plot2.png, etc.

- Create a separate R code file (plot1.R, plot2.R, etc.) that constructs the corresponding plot, i.e. code in plot1.R constructs the plot1.png plot. The code file should include code for reading the data so that the plot can be fully reproduced. Must also include the code that creates the PNG file.

- Add the PNG file and R code file to the top-level folder of the git repository (no need for separate sub-folders)

### Results

This repository consisits of 4 R scripts with their corresponding plot results.
